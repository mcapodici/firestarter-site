# Source code

Let's get the Firestarter code on your machine using Github.

## Use the Github template

* Visit the Github repo [https://github.com/mcapodici/firestarter](https://github.com/mcapodici/firestarter)

* Open the "Use This Template" menu and select "Create a new repository", like this:

![123](/assets/github-create-template.png)

* Enter a name from your repo e.g. `firestarter` or `myproject`
* Enter a description if you wish
* Change it to a `private` repo if you don't want public access.
* Click "Create repository from template"
* Wait for the creation to complete.
* Change the LICENSE file if you don't want to use the MIT license.
* Clone the repo to your local machine. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/myproject.git
```

!!! note

    If you are not familiar with Github cloning, you can read more about it [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories).

!!! info

    If you don't want to use Github, you can download the source code here [**main.zip**](https://github.com/mcapodici/firestarter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), but then you will need to figure out your own source control and deployment setup.
