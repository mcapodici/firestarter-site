# App Configuration (Firebase)

You will now need to get some configuration values out of it so the code can make use of this Firebase project:

* Log into your Firebase account, and go to the console.
* Click your project.
* Under **Get started by adding Firebase to your app**, click the Web icon that looks like `</>`.
* Give the app a nickname, e.g. Firestarter.
* Don't check **Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app**
* Click **Register App**
* Wait for registration.
* Select the "Config" radio box
* Check that the code has a single variable `const firebaseConfig` and no other code. (See example below)
* 
```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  authDomain: "aaaa-aaaaa.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "aaaa-aaaaa",
  storageBucket: "aaaa-aaaaa.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "11111111111",
  appId: "1:11111111111:web:7777777777777777777777"
};
```

* In the box showing the code, like this, click the copy icon.
* Replace the existing `const firebaseConfig` statement in `nextjs/src/firebase/config.ts`, with the one you copied.
* The `config.ts` file should look like this now:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  authDomain: "aaaa-aaaaa.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "aaaa-aaaaa",
  storageBucket: "aaaa-aaaaa.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "11111111111",
  appId: "1:11111111111:web:7777777777777777777777"
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```

* Check that the project builds correctly with this change:
    * On the command line, change directory into the `nextjs` folder.
    * Run `yarn build`.
    * Check that there are no errors.
    * If there are errors, double check you have pasted correctly. 
    * If there are still errors you can raise an [issue on Github](https://github.com/mcapodici/firestarter/issues) and I will help as soon as I can.

* Now run `yarn dev` to run the appplication, and sign up for an account
* Log in to your Firebase account, go to the console, go to your project, and click Authentication. You should see the email you used to create that account listed. This proves you are connecting to your account, not our demo one.

* Commit the changes on `main` and push to Github.
